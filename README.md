# ABOUT THE PROJECT
(„• ᴗ •„)
## Fundamental Idea
Boot is a handheld device designed to help neurodivergent individuals communicate with others. Designed for inclusivity, Boot helps people by explaining the issues the individuals face with their neurodivergence without fearing the extreme anxiety faced in social interactions. This bot has two main functions. The first major function is the ability to verbalise pre-made texts into speech and help people give basic introductions to others that will always remain the same. The second major function is to listen to conversations and help neurodivergent people respond if they are unable to or are not comfortable responding.

## Inputs
For the two functions, there are a total of three different input types required. Firstly, an input to turn on or off the device to conserve power. The second input involves a push button that lets the user slide through the preset response options and choose the one they would like to use in accordance with the situation they are in. The last input involves a microphone that listens to conversation cues and topics and creates creative ways of responding to help the user navigate complex interactions without the fear of making a mistake, which would help them integrate themselves into society.

## Processing
The input data could be processed in three different ways. Firstly, the input of the on-off device would be processed by immediately quitting the program and turning off the ESP32. The selection of the predetermined texts would be processed by using a code that turns text into speech and using an amplifier to send the voice data to the speaker, which would finally be output. The microphone data is processed through a language learning model, which can be obtained from open sources or through training GPTs. The trained GPTs would create text that would be used with the text-to-speech software, which can be found online.

## Output
The final data to be output would be the speech and or display of messages that a person wishes to communicate with.
